            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Choose Qualitty Beans:</b></dt><br>
                    <dd>First things first, quality beans are key. Opt for freshly roasted beans from a reputable source. Whether you prefer
                    light, medium, or dark roast, pick what suits your taste buds.</dd><br>
                
                <dt><b>Grind Fresh:</b></dt>
                    <dd>Invest in a good coffee grinder if you can. Grinding your beans just before brewing preserves the flavor and aroma. 
                    Aim for a consistent grind size based on your brewing method (e.g., coarse for French press, fine for espresso).</dd><br>

                <dt><b>Proper Water Tempearture:</b></dt><br>
                    <dd>Water that's too hot or too cold can ruin your brew. Aim for water around 200°F (93°C). If you don't have a thermometer, wait about 30 seconds after boiling to let it cool slightly.</dd><br>
               
                <dt><b>Measure Your coffee:</b></dt>
                <dd>The coffee-to-water ratio matters. A common starting point is 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of water. Adjust to taste.</dd><br>

                <dt><b>Brewing Methods:</b></dt>
                <dd>There are various methods to choose from: French press, pour-over, AeroPress, drip coffee maker, and espresso machines. Each has its own unique flavor profile.</dd><br>

                <dt><b>Freshness Matters:</b></dt>
                <dd>Coffee is best enjoyed fresh. Try to brew only what you'll drink in one sitting to avoid reheating or storing it for too long.</dd><br>

                <dt><b>Add-Ins:</b></dt>
                <dd>Customize your cup with your choice of milk, cream, sugar, or flavored syrups. Don't be afraid to get creative!</dd><br>

                <dt><b>Enjoy the Experience:</b></dt>
                <dd>Finally, savor your creation. Coffee isn't just about caffeine; it's about the experience. Find a cozy spot, take a sip, and enjoy the moment.</dd><br>
